## Brief

For this project, the team was tasked with fully deploying a fully working, supplied application. The methods and technologies used to deploy the application, however, was the decision of the team to make. The primary focus of this project was to work as part of a team to complete a deliverable as the experience will be invaluable when working with QA in the future.

## Scope

The team was required to work with these externally developed applications:

- [Pet Clinic Angular](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular)
- [Pet Clinic Rest](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest)

The angular application consisted of the front end of the application, which the user would directly interact with. The rest application, in contrast, contained the back end functionality.

The team was required to plan, design and implement an automated deployment solution as part of the development workflow and further deployments of the application. There was no restrictions on which technologies can be used to achieve this goal.

## Project Planning

During the week of development, the team was required to run daily scrums, with the Trainer present, to record progress, discuss implementations and ensure the maintainance of a project planning board. The board would be the most useful piece of technology to track progress and view tasks to be completed, as well as open any issues.

The team, after discussion, research and comparison of technologies, had settled on using AWS Pipeline, Terraform, Kubernetes and Docker to automate development and deployment. A stretch goal of using Amazon RDS for database integration was also decided.


## CI/CD Pipeline

The team, prior to decided on techologies to use, created a CI/CD pipeline in order to understand how the techologies would work together. This diagram is below.
